# The config of the ZombieApocalypse plugin
# Created by 3ricL, minecraft name: Ericdebouwer
# -
# Edit this configuration with care, and NEVER use tabs!
# If this configuration breaks, my plugin will try to explain what should be changed/fixed
# to reset it, simply remove it from the "ZombieApocalypse" folder and it will generate a new one
# -
# You can sometimes pass arguments between curly braces,
# so {world_name} is replaced with the actual world's name for example
# Not including the argument will work just fine, but might be less helpful to users
# You can use color codes by using the §-symbol, as seen on: https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php
